This repository contains source code of the Go implementation of the [Cedar](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/) policy language.

Cedar is a language for writing and enforcing authorization policies in your applications. Using Cedar, you can write policies that specify your applications' fine-grained permissions. Your applications then authorize access requests by calling Cedar's authorization engine. Because Cedar policies are separate from application code, they can be independently authored, updated, analyzed, and audited. You can use Cedar's validator to check that Cedar policies are consistent with a declared schema which defines your application's authorization model.

Cedar is:

### Expressive

Cedar is a simple yet expressive language that is purpose-built to support authorization use cases for common authorization models such as RBAC and ABAC.

### Performant

Cedar is fast and scalable. The policy structure is designed to be indexed for quick retrieval and to support fast and scalable real-time evaluation, with bounded latency.

### Analyzable

Cedar is designed for analysis using Automated Reasoning. This enables analyzer tools capable of optimizing your policies and proving that your security model is what you believe it is.

## Using Cedar

Cedar can be used in your application by importing the `github.com/cedar-policy/cedar-go` package.

## Comparison to the Rust implementation

The Go implementation includes:

- the core authorizer
- JSON marshalling and unmarshalling
- all core and extended types
- integration test suite

The Go implementation does not yet include:

- examples and CLI applications
- schema support and the validator
- the formatter
- partial evaluation

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example of using Cedar in Go:

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"log"

	cedar "github.com/cedar-policy/cedar-go"
)

const policyCedar = `permit (
	principal == User::"alice",
	action == Action::"view",
	resource in Album::"jane_vacation"
  );
`

const entitiesJSON = `[
  {
    "uid": { "type": "User", "id": "alice" },
    "attrs": { "age": 18 },
    "parents": []
  },
  {
    "uid": { "type": "Photo", "id": "VacationPhoto94.jpg" },
    "attrs": {},
    "parents": [{ "type": "Album", "id": "jane_vacation" }]
  }
]`

func main() {
	var policy cedar.Policy
	if err := policy.UnmarshalCedar([]byte(policyCedar)); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	
	ps := cedar.NewPolicySet()
	ps.UpsertPolicy("policy0", &policy)

	var entities cedar.Entities
	if err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(entitiesJSON), &entities); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	req := cedar.Request{
		Principal: cedar.EntityUID{Type: "User", ID: "alice"},
		Action:    cedar.EntityUID{Type: "Action", ID: "view"},
		Resource:  cedar.EntityUID{Type: "Photo", ID: "VacationPhoto94.jpg"},
		Context:   cedar.Record{},
	}

	ok, _ := ps.IsAuthorized(entities, req)
	fmt.Println(ok)
}
```

CLI output:

```
allow
```

This request is allowed because `VacationPhoto94.jpg` belongs to `Album::"jane_vacation"`, and `alice` can view photos in `Album::"jane_vacation"`.
